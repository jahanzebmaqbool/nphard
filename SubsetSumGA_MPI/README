/**
* This program is a distributed memory implementation of SubsetSum problem using Message Passing Interface.
* I have parallelized this in rather unusual domain decomposition contrary to existing GA paralleization 
* techniques employed which is population wise domain decomposition. Instead of going for this, I used
* Chromosome wise domain decomposition and column wise division of population.
